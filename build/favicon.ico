The file /digital-wedding-invitation/digital-wedding-invitation/public/favicon.ico is typically a binary file representing the favicon image. Since I cannot generate binary content directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image file and place it in the specified location.

If you need a placeholder or specific instructions on how to create a favicon, please let me know!
